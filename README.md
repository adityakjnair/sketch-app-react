#Real-time Collaborative Sketching Application
This is a sketching tool which supports collaborative work.
It uses ReactJS for the front-end and NodeJS for backend.
This application employs the publish/subscribe pattern implemented in pusher-js to get realtime updates of other users sketching on the same canvas.
